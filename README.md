# The Simon Game
This is a simple game created using JavaScriot. There are four squares displayed on the screen, each with its own unique color and sound when tapped. The game is played between the player and the computer, where they take turns. The computer randomly selects a square to tap, and then the player must repeat all the previous square taps made by the computer from the start of the game.
